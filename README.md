# BluetoothRobotCar
Basic Arduino based car that avoids obstacles. The code is uploaded to GitHub to not loose my progress. Bluetooth control via Android app is under progress.

## How it runs
Well, not very good not so bad. All the motors and sonars work. The bluetooth module also works. In the attached demo, the car is set to run in a circular track. When I put my shoe in front of the car, it stops. When I release it runs again.
